# Build Status

**Last updated:** 2026-09-30

## Phase

**Phase 3 — database design.** Authorized by the owner on 2026-09-30
([Constitution §35](SMARTSTORE-CONSTITUTION.md)). Schema, entities, keys, constraints, indexes, and the migrations
that create them.

**Stack chosen:** [ADR-31](docs/architecture/ADR-31-V1-STACK-AND-TOOLING.md), approved by the owner on 2026-09-30 —
Node 26, TypeScript, Fastify 5, `pg` (no ORM), dbmate (plain-SQL, forward-only migrations), Vitest against a real
PostgreSQL, React + Vite. PostgreSQL is fixed per `ADR-03`. **No migration and no application code exists yet.**

Phase 2 documentation is closed. All thirteen entry criteria (C-01..C-13) are met or decided
([PHASE-3-ENTRY-CRITERIA.md](docs/architecture/PHASE-3-ENTRY-CRITERIA.md) §6), and no genuine Phase 3 blockers
remain. The last one, `CON-03`, was closed by owner decision **D-14**.

## v1 slice — in scope

| Area | Notes |
|---|---|
| Single store | One store, not multi-store |
| Online POS | Online sales; the offline-sync engine is deferred |
| Barcode | Scanning and lookup |
| Inventory ledger | Balance plus append-only movements (`ADR-05`); no stock column on product |
| Payments | Card, cash, split tender (`ADR-09`); a `Failed` `Payment` record is terminal, a retry is a new `Payment` (D-14) |
| Returns | Return and refund, bounded per line and per sale |
| Audit | Append-only audit trail; small deliberate per-machine type set (D-06) |

## Deferred — design for, do not build yet

| Area | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Offline sync | `OF-*` rules are specified; the sync engine is not in v1 (D-04 chose allow-and-reconcile) |
| RFID / devices | Hardware abstraction is specified (`HD-*`); no fleet is committed, and budget is open (`GAP-039`) |
| Credit | No `CreditOverdue` event, no AR aging, no dunning in v1 (D-05) |
| Loyalty | Accrual basis is documented and configurable (D-11), but no loyalty build in v1 |
| Multi-store | Warehouse attribution is designed for future multi-store (D-03); v1 is single-store |

Design these so the schema can carry them without a rewrite. Do not build them.

Test gates deferred with them (`TEST-STRATEGY.md` §1, ADR-31 §7): idempotency of offline apply (`OF-22/23`) waits for
offline sync; atomic bounded redemptions (`PY-31`, `BI-19`, `BI-06`) wait for credit and loyalty. Online idempotency
(`SM-04`) is tested in v1.

## Working agreements

Owner-approved with ADR-31 on 2026-09-30 (ADR-31 §13 has the full text):

1. Step 2 designs all seven domains, in the owner's order, before any application code. Actor foreign keys in
   domains 3 to 6 are added in domain 7. Step 3 implements in dependency order 1, 7, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5.
2. A sale requires a shift (`BI-39`), so a minimal Shift/Drawer belongs to the Sale/Payment domain. Nothing else from
   Cash.
3. Movement types come from `inventory-domain.md` (includes `OPENING_BALANCE`), not the shorter list in
   PHASE-2-ARCHITECTURE §9.3.
4. Card payments are an interface plus a simulated gateway; a real acquirer is the owner's call. Tax rates are data;
   fixtures are labelled TEST-ONLY.
5. Work is on branch `v1-build`; commit after each passing step; remind the owner to push at the end of each domain.
6. Migrations are forward-only.

## Done

- 2026-09-30 — ADR-31 (stack and tooling) written and approved by the owner.
- 2026-09-30 — Tooling scaffold. **TESTED** (2 tests passing; environment in ADR-31 §14):
  - npm workspaces (`server`); dependencies pinned exactly, `min-release-age=7`, `engine-strict`.
  - dbmate migrations in `db/migrations/`, forward-only; `db/schema.sql` generated.
  - Vitest harness: one template database migrated per run, a private clone per test file, pools as both roles.
  - `server/test/citations.test.ts`: every table, constraint, index, function, trigger and domain must carry a
    `Cites:` comment whose IDs appear in `/docs`; a self-test proves the checker flags violations.
  - `scripts/db-setup.ps1` + `db-bootstrap.sql`: creates `smartstore_owner` and `smartstore_app` and the dev database,
    and writes `.env`. Tested on a scratch cluster: fresh run, refusal when `.env` exists, `-ResetPasswords`, and both
    URLs log in under `scram-sha-256`.
  - `docs/database/CONVENTIONS.md`: naming, keys, time, money, quantity, vocabularies, scoping, deletion, grants,
    citations, migrations.
  - `d0` foundation migration: the `nonblank_text` domain.
- 2026-09-30 — **Domain 1 — Organization / Store / Warehouse.** DESIGNED + IMPLEMENTED (migration) + **TESTED**
  (57 tests passing). No application code. [D1 design](docs/database/D1-ORGANIZATION-STORE-WAREHOUSE.md).
  - Tables: `currency`, `organization`, `store`, `store_setting_version` (append-only, `REQ-AU-06`), `warehouse`,
    `storage_location`, `storage_location_attribution` (D-03), `document_type`, `document_number_sequence` +
    `allocate_document_number()` (`BI-42`).
  - Schema-wide tests added: every table's scope classified (`RT-001`), no float columns (`BI-01`), runtime role
    has no `DELETE` anywhere, append-only tables have no `UPDATE`, `created_at` is always server time (`RT-353`),
    no cascading foreign keys (`AU-32`).
  - Mutation-checked: three guards removed one at a time, each test went red.
  - Guards that depend on later tables are registered in CONVENTIONS §12 and D1 §6, not stubbed.

## In progress

- Domain 2 (Product / Barcode / Unit): design document and migration.

## Owner actions pending

1. Upgrade Node: `winget upgrade OpenJS.NodeJS` (installed 25.8.2 is end of life; 26 is the approved runtime).
2. Run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\db-setup.ps1` once. It asks for the `postgres`
   password locally and writes `.env`. Then `npm ci`, `npm run db:migrate`, `npm test`.
3. Push `v1-build` at the end of each domain.

Until then, tests run on a scratch PostgreSQL 17.11 cluster and a portable Node 26 in the session scratch directory
(ADR-31 §14). Nothing on the owner's PostgreSQL service is touched.

## Next

1. **Domain 2 — Product / Barcode / Unit.** Barcode lookup is an exact match on a unique index (`PR-08`, `PR-12`,
   `UX-48`) and is the scan path for the ~100 ms budget.
2. Then continue domain by domain — one at a time, with tests, committing after each passing step: 3 Inventory
   ledger / Batch, 4 Sale / Payment, 5 Returns / Refunds, 6 Audit, 7 Employee / Role / Permission.
3. Then Step 3, implementation, in the order in the working agreements.

Update this file after every step, including steps that failed and were abandoned.

## Log

Append-only. One dated line per step, including failed and abandoned attempts.

- 2026-09-30 — ADR-31 proposed, then approved by the owner ("approved which makes my project latency low use it";
  read as: approved as proposed, lowest-latency option where a choice existed — Fastify, Node 26). The installed
  Node is v25.8.2, which is end of life and outside Vitest 5's declared `engines`; the owner has to upgrade it
  (`winget upgrade OpenJS.NodeJS`).
- 2026-09-30 — Tooling scaffold. Four failed attempts, each fixed and kept here:
  (1) `pg_ctl start` through the tool shell hung, because the server inherited the tool's output pipes. Fixed by
  starting `postgres.exe` detached with redirected output.
  (2) `dbmate --strict migrate` failed with "flag provided but not defined": in dbmate 2.36.0 `--strict` belongs to
  `migrate`. Corrected to `migrate --strict` (ADR-31 §14).
  (3) The first citation test failed because the foundation migration has no tables and the test demanded at least
  one. The test was wrong. It now checks that a migration is recorded, and a self-test plants violations to prove the
  checker is not vacuous.
  (4) Vitest 5.0.3 was published today, so the new 7-day release-age rule excludes it; pinned 5.0.1.
  The scratch cluster first ran with `fsync` and `synchronous_commit` off. It was restarted with defaults before any
  measurement, so later timings are not flattered.
- 2026-09-30 — Domain 1. Two failed attempts, each fixed:
  (1) The new schema-wide test caught a real defect in the draft migration: `GRANT INSERT ON currency` was
  table-level, which let the application supply `created_at`. Changed to a column-level grant before commit. The
  migration had only been applied to throwaway test databases.
  (2) The first mutation check reported the central-not-sellable test as vacuous. It was the harness that was wrong:
  the mutated migration still had the constraint's `COMMENT`, so it failed to apply and no test ran. Redone properly,
  the test goes red. The migration file was restored byte for byte after each mutation.
  Also: the untracked `docs.zip` present at session start is gone from the working tree. This session's commands did
  not delete it (the one `Remove-Item` attempted was blocked, and it targeted a scratch file). Flagged to the owner.
